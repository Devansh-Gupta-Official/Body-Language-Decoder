# Body Language Recognition using Mediapipe and Machine Learning

## **Overview**
This project focuses on real-time body language recognition using Mediapipe, OpenCV, and Machine Learning. It leverages pose estimation and face landmarks to classify body language gestures captured via webcam. The system identifies and predicts various body language postures, aiding in applications related to human-computer interaction and non-verbal communication analysis.

## **How it Works**
The project is divided into two primary components:
